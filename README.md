# Screen Curtain

* Authors: Babbage B.V., Joseph Lee
* Download [stable version][1]

This add-on brings NVDA Core issue 7857 to life: adding screen curtain functionality on Windows 8 and later.

To use this add-on, go to NVDA menu/Tools/Screen Curtain. If the item is checked, screen curtain is active, otherwise it is off. You can also assign a command to toggle screen curtian from everywhere.

IMPORTANT: this is a proof of concept add-on. Once the relevant feature is included in NVDA, this add-on will be discontinued.

## Version 18.08
